# Binary Classification without using High Level API (like Tensorflow, Keasr, Sklearn)


## Preferable IDE: 
- Spyder 

## Objective of this Code:
1. To understand how artificial neural networks work in classifying datasets. (In this code, the Iris dataset has been used.)
2. To comprehend the process of coding an artificial neural network. (In this code, a single neuron has been employed.) This is achieved without relying on high-level APIs like TensorFlow, Keras, or Scikit-learn.

## Overview of this Code:
The code is structured with clear steps and comments, along with relevant links to enhance the code's understandability.

## Special Note:
This code is designed for binary classification. However, the Iris dataset originally has three classes. Therefore, during the preprocessing step, one class has been omitted from the Iris dataset to facilitate model training.
